# backgroundgps

# EDIT: Please find the updated code (Based on Android Studio and saving the locations in DB) here:

https://github.com/atishagrawal/androidbackgroundgps

Run gps as a service in background like when the application is installed it starts and periodically send the coordinates to web server

Notes:-
  1. You will need Google Maps for Android API Key to be added to this project
  2. You will need a webserver which will periodically collect the location being sent from the application.
  3. The webFile folder contains two example files for the webserver.
  4. You will have to update the track URL as per your requirements. This track URL is the endpoint for your PHP file which is responsible to fetch Data from the android apps.
